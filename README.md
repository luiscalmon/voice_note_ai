# Voice Note AI

Voice Note AI is a simple Flutter application that lets you record voice notes and automatically transcribe them into text. Voice recognition is powered by AI thanks to advanced speech recognition technology available in your device's operating system. Manage your notes easily with a clean material design interface.

This project serves as a proof of concept developed entirely using OpenAI Codex.
